    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian
      origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based
      dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
      (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
      which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
      oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes
      pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

      The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin
      manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border
      with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and
      its variants have since become popular in many countries.] It has become
      one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in
      Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants
      specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via
      pizza delivery, and as street food. Various food companies sell
      ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated
      in a home oven.
