    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti (Italian: [spaˈɡetti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical
      pasta.[1] It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other
      pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched
      with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum
      wheat semolina.[2] Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is
      used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of
      spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin spaghetti.

      Originally, spaghetti was notably long, but shorter lengths gained in
      popularity during the latter half of the 20th century and now it is most
      commonly available in 25–30 cm (10–12 in) lengths. A variety of pasta
      dishes are based on it and it is frequently served with tomato sauce or
      meat or vegetables.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 ¾ cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 10 minutes. Scoop out some of the cooking water and reserve.
        Drain spaghetti.

      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper;
        cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spaghetti and Pecorino
        Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup of reserved cooking water; stir until
        cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Add more cooking water until sauce
        coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.
